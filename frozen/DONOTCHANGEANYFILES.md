Please do not change any code in these files unless you _really_ know what you're doing.
 
Any updates to these files must be manually copied to Prateek/Martin's codebase, otherwise things
will break. Soon, we will have the p2p simulator repo re-packaged to be pip installable. At that point,
this codebase (Nasim's) will import covid_p2p_simulation, and reference these files. Until that point,
DO NOT TOUCH THESE FILES.

For reference: this copy is up-to-date with 51eaf634ebb3c2be61a2e5a03bdaedc8493f5563, and slightly
modified to remove access to the list of pre-existing conditions (`PREEXISTING_CONDITIONS`).
